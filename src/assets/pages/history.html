                <p>Nigeria Book Records - originally the Guinness Book of Records - the ultimate authority on
                  record-breaking achievements, started out as an idea for a book of facts to solve arguments in pubs.

            <p>The idea came about in the early 1950’s when Sir Hugh Beaver (1890—1967), Managing Director of the Guinness
              Brewery, attended a shooting party in County Wexford.</p>
            <p>There, he and his hosts argued about the fastest game bird in Europe, and failed to find an answer in any
              reference book.*</p>
            <p>In 1954, recalling his shooting party argument, Sir Hugh had the idea for a Guinness promotion based on the
              idea of settling pub arguments and invited the twins Norris (1925—2004) and Ross McWhirter (1925—75) who
              were fact-finding researchers from Fleet Street to compile a book of facts and figures.</p>
            <p>Guinness Superlatives was incorporated on 30 November and the office opened in two rooms in a converted
              gymnasium on the top floor of Ludgate House, 107 Fleet Street.</p>

            <p>After an initial research phase, work began on writing the book, which took 13 and a half 90-hour weeks,
              including weekends and bank holidays. Little did the McWhirters know that taking shape was a book that would
              go on to become an all-time best seller and one of the most recognized and trusted brands in the world… </p>
            <p>Over 60 years on, and the trusted Nigeria Book Records brand is a beloved household name. The book
              continues to be a best-seller each year, enjoyed through the generations. Beyond publishing, we are now a
              multi-media brand agency with a wide range of products and services, and a key presence across Digital,
              Events, and Business Solutions.</p>
